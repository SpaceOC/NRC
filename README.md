# Attention!
## Do not use the NRC version from this branch, for this version is not ready yet and is only under development. It is not suitable for use in your projects (pseudo-OS). Please wait for the release of the new version.

NRC (Not Real Core) is a core designed to simplify and speed up the creation of C/C++ pseudo-OS.

What is currently available:
- User Management Manager (and the users themselves)
- A class that allows you to easily insert your commands into the core without changing the core itself (so far it works with commands that don't have any arguments in their functions)
- Data and file managers (one chained by a third-party library from nlohmann, the other contains simple commands for creating folders and files, checking them, deleting them...)
- And a small arsenal of commands that are already built into NRC (commands.cpp).
- And nobody needs the print class lol

Documentation (needs full correspondence + only Russian version available at the moment) - https://spaceoc.gitbook.io/nrc-docs-ru/
